# Libertarianizm

Libertarianizm (*ang. Libertaianism*)

Regu≈Çy wolnego runku

* strong rights theory
* individual right, fundamental right to liberty

Rober Nozick
Society's laws should leave people free to choose how to live their lives, so long as they do not violate anyone else's rights.

Unjust for Libertarianism:
* Laws that restrict people's liberty for the sake of their own good.
* Laws that restrict people's freedom in the name of a particular moral code.
* Laws that redistribute wealth.

Distribution is just if:
* All property was initially acquired justly, and then was transferred to others through free exchange.

The libertarian theory says we can't just add up and aggregate preferences and satisfactions that way we have to respect persons (take money from Bill Gates for poor)

Noziak forced labor = taxation
