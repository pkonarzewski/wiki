# SOLID

Opis

## S - Single responsibility principle

## O - Open/closed principle

A class is open to extension but closed to modification. We prefer to wrap or extend classes. We prefer not to modify or tweak a class. When we make a change to a class, we are careful to be sure that the ripple touches the entire hierarchy and all of the collaborators.

## L - Liskov substitution principle

In essence, this is a test for proper polymorphism. If classes are truly polymorphic, one can be substituted for another.

## I - Interface segregation principle

## D - Dependency inversion principle

This principle guides us toward creating common abstractions.
